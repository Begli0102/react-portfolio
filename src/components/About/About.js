            I am a Frontend Developer and former entrepreneur with a teaching
            background. I have always been interested in web applications, how
            to build how to run them, how to write a code. One youtube video
            sparked my curiosity. I started a full-stack web development boot
            camp and completed it successfully. During the boot camp, I have
            learned so many new things. Learning to code gave me a newfound
            appreciation of the work that gets put into the technology that many
            take for granted. I love the idea of bringing my imagination to life
            and developing my own technical solutions. In my teaching years, I
            have learned how to cooperate with team members to grow together and
            developed communication skills. Adaptability to the new environment
            is one of my core transferable skills. From trading years I have
            learned how to organize the working process by dividing it into a
            small to-do list
          </p>

            My eagerness for continuous learning makes me a better Frontend
            Developer. After work, I used to learn methodology on how to gain a
            maximum result from each subject. With this mindset, I would like to
            bmy future company. Besides this, my goal will be to learn and
            accelerate my professional and personal development from experienced
            team members and grow together.
